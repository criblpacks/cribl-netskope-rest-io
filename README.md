# Cribl Netskope Rest Collector
----
## About this Pack

This pack is built as a complete SOURCE + DESTINATION solution (identified by the IO suffix). Data collection and delivery happen entirely within the Pack's context - you can choose how data arrives at a DESTINATION:
*  *Send to Worker Group Routes* (the default): data is sent to the top-level Worker Group Routes.
*  *Default Destination*: data is sent to the Worker Group's [Default Destination](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/destinations-default/). 
*  *In-Pack Destination*: data is sent to one or more Destinations configured within the Pack.

This Pack is designed to collect, process, and output Netskope Alert and Event data using the [Netskope V2 REST API](https://docs.netskope.com/en/using-the-rest-api-v2-dataexport-iterator-endpoints). 

The Pack includes optional Splunk output processing that maps data to Splunk sourcetypes compatible with the [Netskope Add-on for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3808).

## Deployment

* Every bundled Source within this pack adds a hidden field: `__packsource`. This field allows for simplified routing based on the Pack source.
* This pack is configured by default to use the Destination *Send to Worker Group Routes*. You *must* add either a Worker Group Route or rely on the Default Destination.
* To explicitly use the Worker Group's *Default Destination*, change the Pack's Routes to *default:default*. The Pack will then route the data to the destination currently set as the Default on the Worker Group.

### Configure the Collectors
* Obtain a `Netskope API Base URL` and `API Token` from your Netskope Administrator and update the Pack variables with this information (see below for details).
* Perform a Commit and Deploy - this ensures that Preview works correctly. 
* Perform a **Run > Preview** of each Collector to verify that they work correctly.
* Schedule the Collectors and adjust the schedule as needed. 

### Configure Output Format

Each data type can be configured to output data in either normalized JSON or Splunk (`_raw` + Splunk fields) format. Enable *only one* format for each of the following pipelines:
* `netskope_alerts`
* `netskope_events`

### Configure your Destination/Update Pack Routes
To ensure proper data routing, you must make a choice: retain the current setting to use the Default Destination defined by your Worker Group, or define a new Destination directly inside this pack and adjust the pack's routes accordingly.

### Commit and Deploy
Once everything is configured, perform a Commit & Deploy to enable data collection.

#### Variables

The Pack has the following variables:
* `netskope_tenant_url`: The full base URL to your Netskope deployment.
* `netskope_api_token`: Your V2 API Token (*must* be a V2 token!)
* `netskope_alerts_index`: The "index" name that Netskope will use for tracking state. See [here](https://docs.netskope.com/en/using-the-rest-api-v2-dataexport-iterator-endpoints) for information. In general, this does not need to be changed.
* `netskope_events_index`: As above but for Events. 
* `netskope_default_splunk_index`: Default index for the Splunk output.
